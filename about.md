Hi, I'm Kim Nam-Il!  
I graduated from Sogang University with a degree in Economics and earned an M.Sc. in Financial Engineering from KAIST.  
I’ve worked at KBS (Korean Broadcasting System) and WorldQuant, a subsidiary of Millennium Management.  
Currently, I’m interested in data science, quantitative analysis, and artificial intelligence.
