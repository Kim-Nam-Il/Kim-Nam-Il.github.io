Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹  

I graduated from Sogang University with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics, where I developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and economic theory. Afterwards, I pursued a Master of Science in Financial Engineering at KAIST, honing my skills in advanced quantitative techniques, financial modeling, and computational methods.

My professional journey has been both diverse and rewarding. At the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), I focused on data analysis and language modeling, using data-driven insights to improve content strategies and streamline operations. Subsequently, I joined WorldQuant, a subsidiary of Millennium Management, where I performed in-depth quantitative research. My responsibilities included building revenue models, constructing covariance matrices, and running stock price simulations to inform high-stakes investment strategies in a fast-paced, global financial environment.

I am deeply passionate about data science, quantitative analysis, and artificial intelligence, particularly how they converge to tackle complex problems, optimize decision-making, and drive innovation. If youâ€™d like to connect, collaborate, or discuss potential opportunities, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out at **inflow-wallop0l [at] icloud.com**. Iâ€™d be delighted to chat!
