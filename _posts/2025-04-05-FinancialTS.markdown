## Revising "Python Implementation for *Financial Time Series* by Ruey S. Tsay"

I’m currently in the process of updating this blog post on GitHub Pages to reflect the latest version of my project, "Python Implementation for *Financial Time Series* by Ruey S. Tsay." The content below is a work in progress and will soon be refined to provide a clearer and more polished overview of the repository, its purpose, and the progress made so far.

For now, you can refer to the original structure and details I’m working from:

- The project is inspired by Ruey S. Tsay's book, *Analysis of Financial Time Series*, and aims to fill the gap in Python-based resources for its concepts.
- It includes Python code examples (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) aligned with the book’s chapters, starting with "Financial Time Series and Their Characteristics" and "Linear Time Series Analysis and Its Applications."
- Progress updates show completed demonstrations and exercises for Chapters 1 and 2, with more chapters to come.
- Data files needed for the code are available on [Ruey S. Tsay's website](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ruey-s-tsay/research/analysis-of-financial-time-series-3rd-edition).

Stay tuned for the revised version, which will include updated links, a streamlined progress overview, and additional details about how to use the repository. In the meantime, feel free to explore the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Financial-Time-Ruey-Tsay/dp/8126548932/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ISBN+978-0-470-41435-4&qid=1577994389&sr=8-1/) or check out the existing code in the GitHub repository!
