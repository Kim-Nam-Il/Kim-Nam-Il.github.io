Hi, I'm Kim Nam-Il!  
Greetings, I’m Nam-Il Kim.  
I graduated from Sogang University with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics, where I cultivated a robust foundation in analytical thinking and economic theory. Following this, I pursued a Master of Science in Financial Engineering at KAIST, sharpening my skills in advanced quantitative techniques, financial modeling, and computational methods.  

My professional journey has been both diverse and enriching. At the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), I worked on data analysis and language modeling, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance content strategies and operational efficiency. Later, I joined WorldQuant, a subsidiary of Millennium Management, where I engaged in sophisticated quantitative research. My responsibilities there included developing revenue models, constructing covariance matrices, and conducting stock price simulations to support high-stakes investment strategies in a dynamic, global financial environment.  

Currently, I am deeply passionate about the fields of data science, quantitative analysis, and artificial intelligence. I am particularly intrigued by how these disciplines can intersect to address complex challenges, optimize decision-making, and unlock innovative solutions with far-reaching impact.  
If you’d like to connect, collaborate, or explore potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me at [inflow-wallop0l@icloud.com](mailto:inflow-wallop0l@icloud.com). I’d be delighted to engage in a conversation!
